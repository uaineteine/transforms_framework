Metadata Transformations Framework
=========================

This program provides a data transformation framework for working with tables (DataFrames) in PySpark, Pandas, or Polars. It tracks all transformations and important events in a structured, auditable way using JSON logs.

Description
=========================

This framework makes your data pipeline transparent and auditable by logging every important action as a structured JSON event. You can trace exactly what happened to each table, when, and why. The framework provides three main approaches for managing tables:

1. **Direct table loading** with `MetaFrame` for single table operations

2. **Payload-based loading** with `SupplyLoad` for configuration-driven multi-table loading

3. **Collection management** with `Tablecollection` for flexible multi-table operations

Each approach provides the same event tracking and audit capabilities while offering different levels of control and automation for your specific use case.
