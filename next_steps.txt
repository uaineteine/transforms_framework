I need a warning display when I select by names
I need a info method to show information on these tables, nrows for example
Interactive table presentation/display - itables

Delta table load - need to bring these in for user show
  These are also pipe delimitted
processing_comments
review_comments
safe_data_comments

grab the person key - scram pin
column info has a bool for person key makes life easy

Profiling reports can just be deferred to the worm for this

Template can show 4.x for each of the tables we need to process, 5-7 for saving and such.
Update this template to really display the information we need.

In the create notebook, allow people to tick if they want to transform

pre-populated for transforms
call transforms that table

save_all at the end of the spark

sample_row in worm - get it all going.
